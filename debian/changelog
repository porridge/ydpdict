ydpdict (1.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Cherry-picking some upstream fixes for squeeze
    - documentation updates
    - license text update and copyright clarification
    - copyright year updates
    - a fix for severity=important segfault with newer libao library caused by
      an uninitialized data structure field (closes: #591464)
    - a fix for buggy sample file path computation (closes: #592067) - it is
      severity normal, but I chose to include it because it is a trivial,
      extremely low risk change
  * Bumping Standards-Version to 3.9.1. Necessary changes were:
    - clarify the non-freeness of the package in debian/copyright
    - use the policy-suggested makefile snippet for handling noopt
